# The Simpsons

29 Years of IMDB ratings & US Viewership

The Simpsons are about to begin their 30th season which began back in 1989. In twenty-nine seasons, 639 episodes have aired. This is an analysis of the ratings and US viewership. For the ratings I dowloaded a number of files from IMDB, and cleaned the data accordingly. For US Viewership I pulled the data from Wikipedia.
